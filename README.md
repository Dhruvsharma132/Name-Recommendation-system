In this study, we delve into the fascinating inter
section of facial recognition technology and personal identity,
 exploring how deep learning can predict names based on facial
 features. We utilized the Names100 dataset, an extensive collec
tion of photographs each labeled with a common first name, to
 train a neural network model. This model integrates the sequence
 modeling capabilities of LSTM networks with the advanced
 feature extraction offered by EfficientNetB0. Our goal was to
 uncover the subtle, often culturally and genetically embedded
 patterns that facial features may reveal about a person’s name.
 This endeavor not only pushes the boundaries of traditional facial
 recognition technology but also enriches our understanding of the
 links between appearance and identity. The implications of our
 research are vast, extending from enhancing user interactions on
 digital platforms to opening new pathways in digital forensics
 and cultural studies.
